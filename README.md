# Optimal_control_of_hybrid_quantum_systems
The interaction of light with matter has been at the forefront of major developments in physics ranging from development of photovoltaic cells to designing quantum devices. A novel example is the interaction between an ensemble of solid-state spins with the electromagnetic modes of a superconducting resonator, often called a “hybrid quantum system”. Here, the properties of the individual systems complement each other and provide a synergistic advantage in the design of several quantum protocols, such as quantum memories and processors. However, it is often challenging to study and optimally control these large quantum systems involving hundreds or thousands of spins. We have derived effective models to study such hybrid quantum systems in the low-excitation regime. The main aim of the project here would be to use such effective models to optimally control these systems and find some simple design for efficient implementation of quantum memory protocols or quantum gates.
